# :rocket: Parallel Programming Project: Seam Carving Optimization

## :mag: Overview

This project focuses on optimizing image resizing using seam carving techniques within the domain of parallel programming. Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing, developed by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir, that intelligently adjusts image dimensions while preserving important features.

## :dart: Objective

The primary goal of this project is to delve into the intricacies of seam carving techniques and their application in optimizing the image resizing process. The project spans across multiple stages including analysis, identification and design, parallel implementation, optimization, documentation, and reflection.

## :file_folder: Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Description**: Provides an overview of the project's objectives and the chosen application (image resizing using seam carving).

2. **Sequential Implementation**: Details the sequential implementation approach for image resizing through seam carving.

3. **Parallel Implementation**: Discusses the parallelization strategy for critical steps in image resizing.

4. **Optimizations**: Describes the optimization iterations aimed at improving performance.

5. **Reflection**: Reflects on the difficulties encountered, learnings gained, and areas for further exploration.

6. **References**: Lists the references consulted during the project.
